  description: "# Introduction\n\nIn order to improve trust in the open banking ecosystem, this work proposes a\nprotocol for *traceability*---the ability for consumers to track how data\nis being used and shared, even (and especially) across organizational\nboundaries. Traceability will help achieve reliable, scalable detection of data\nmisuse, leading to both better internal processes and more effective\nintervention by enforcement authorities when necessary.\n\nThe main participants in the open banking ecosystem are:\n1. *Consumers.* Individuals who want to use digital financial services.\n2. *Data providers.* Companies (e.g., traditional banks, payment providers,\n   credit card providers) that hold consumer financial data.\n3. *Data recipients.* Companies (e.g., fintechs, payment processors, credit\n   reference agencies, regulators) that use consumer financial data to provide\n   requested services.\n4. *Data access platforms.* Intermediaries (e.g., API providers, data\n   aggregators) that support data exchange between data providers and data\n   recipients.\n\nTo facilitate traceability, we introduce the idea of a *traceability\nservice*, which stores traceability information on behalf of\nconsumers. Traceability services have three deployment models:\n\n1. *Self-hosted.* Consumers self-host traceability services on their personal\n   machines or in the cloud.\n2. *Third-party-hosted.* Third-party providers (e.g., nongovernmental\n   organizations, private companies) host traceability services.\n3. *Provider-hosted.* Data providers host traceability services (given their\n   existing trust relationships with consumers).\n\nThese traceability services will record various types of traceability *attestations*:\n\n1. *Policy attestations.* These describe agreed-upon terms of *granular*\n   consent, delineating the relevant data types, their intended usage, the\n   duration of data retention, the conditions under which data may be reshared,\n   and logging requirements.\n2. *Sharing attestations.* These describe sharing actions on data elements\n   includes information, such as the timestamps and purposes of sharing.\n3. *Activity attestations.* These describe local actions on data elements (e.g.,\n   use, deletion) and includes information, such as the timestamps and purposes\n   of the actions.\n4. *Rights attestations.* These describe actions associated with data rights\n   requests, such as consent grant, consent revocation, data access, data\n   correction, and data deletion.\n   \nA traceability protocol is comprised of several subprotocols:\n\n1. *Traceability setup.* This is a three-party protocol, involving a consumer,\n    data controller (i.e., a data provider or a data recipient), and\n    traceability service. The consumer authorizes the controller to interact\n    with the traceability service on its behalf. Concretely, this can be\n    implemented using OAuth, where the controller (either a data provider or a\n    data recipient) is an OAuth client and the traceability service acts as the\n    authorization and resource servers.\n2. *Data sharing setup.* This is a four-party protocol, involving a consumer,\n\tdata provider, data recipient, and traceability service. The consumer\n\tinitiates data sharing between the provider and the recipient (e.g., using\n\tthe FDX protocol), and the recipient and provider both post consent records\n\tto the traceability service.\n3. *Data sharing.* This is a three-party protocol, involving a data provider,\n   data recipient, and traceability service. The recipient requests data from the\n   provider (e.g., using the FDX protocol), and receives the data and a \"consentID\"\n   in return. Finally, the recipient and provider both post sharing attestations to\n   the traceability service.\n4. *Data use.* This is a two-party protocol, involving a data controller and\n   traceability service. The controller posts an activity attestation to the\n   traceability service.\n5. *Consumer rights request.* This is a three-party protocol, involving a\n   consumer, controller, and traceability service based on the Data Rights\n   Protocol (DRP). The consumer initiates a rights request with the traceability\n   service, which forwards the request to the controller. The controller posts a\n   rights attestation to the traceability service.\n\n\n# Terms and Definitions\n\n| Terms | Definition |\n|-------|------------|\n| JWS  | [JSON Web Signature](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7797/) |\n| JWT  | [JSON Web Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) |\n| OAuth | [OAuth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) |\n| FDX   | [FDX](https://financialdataexchange.org/) |\n| PKI   | [PKI](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/public_key_infrastructure) |\n| mTLS  | [mTLS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5246) |\n| HTTP  | [HTTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231) |\n\n# Change History\n\n| Version | Description | Date | Author |\n|-------|------------|------------|------------|\n| **0.1** | Initital Verision                             | 3/17/2024 | Dean Wen   | \n| **0.2** | Updated Introduction                          | 3/30/2024 | Kevin Liao | \n| **0.3** | Added user dashboard and violation notify API | 4/12/2024 | Dean Wen   |\n| **0.4** | Revised consents and data APIs, de-scope migration APIs | 5/12/2024 | Dean Wen   | "
